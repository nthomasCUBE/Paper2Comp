# Paper2Comp
comparing papers based on word frequency

It uses the two R packages 'wordcloud' and 'pdftools'.
It is possible to upload two different publications as a PDF.
In addition, it is possible to only consider gene names, to
find out which whether genes are found in the two studies by
considering e.g. human genes.
